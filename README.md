## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome.

Gyazo for Linux is maintained by Nota Inc. But the development is not as active as that of Windows / Mac versions. We can't fix a reported problem soon.

If you want a problem fixed soon, we recommend you fix it by yourself.

We would be glad if you send a PR to this repository.
